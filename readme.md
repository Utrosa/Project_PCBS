# The Shams Illusion

## About the Project

Japanese researchers asked naive observers how many visual
flashes were presented on the screen when these flashes 
were accompanied by different number of beeps on each
trial. The results show that the auditory stimulation 
induced a visual illusion.

## Aim

The aim is to replicate the experiment and test it with 
students or friends to see how reliable the illusion is.

## Getting Started
